# Diagrams

Architecture and concept diagrams for the tutorial. Each diagram is a
pair:

- `<name>.svg` — the themed vector image the site embeds (this is what
  renders).
- `<name>.excalidraw` — the **editable source**. Open it at
  excalidraw.com to revise, then re-export the SVG (File → Export image
  → SVG) — or regenerate both from the spec (see below).

Embed a diagram in a chapter with the include:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include excalidraw.html
   file="ebpf-lifecycle"
   alt="describe the diagram for screen readers"
   caption="Figure N.x — short caption" %}{% endraw %}
```

| `sockops-cb` | 30 | sock_ops callbacks scoped to a cgroup |
| `tc-clsact` | 31 | clsact ingress/egress hooks and the tc verdict set |
| `xdp-path` | 32 | where XDP sits in the RX path (earliest, before sk_buff) and its verdicts |

| `userspace-ebpf` | 51 | the same eBPF bytecode in a user-space VM (rbpf) |
| `kfuncs` | 52 | helpers vs kfuncs + the KF_ACQUIRE/KF_RELEASE discipline |

## Regenerating

`generate.py` is the spec-based compiler that produced these pairs
(clean themed SVG + valid Excalidraw JSON from one description). It
encodes the shared palette and layout helpers so new diagrams stay
visually consistent. The committed `.excalidraw` files remain the
editable source of record; `generate.py` is the convenience path.
